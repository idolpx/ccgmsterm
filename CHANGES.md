Version 2016a
-------------
 - Fixed a baud rate bug on PAL systems.  Patch by Jim Drew.

 - Changed version banner to '2016a' unless making historical build
 - Changed author's message.

   in Transactor, Vol 9 Issue 3.
 - Fixed XModem upload last character drop bug

Version 5.5+ (09/14/2016)
------------------------
 - Reconstructed 5.5+ changed and added to source

Version 5.5 (09/11/2016)
------------------------
 - Resurrected 5.5 source code and released via github.
 - Source code now cross-assembles under ca65.  Original 5?.gs files replaced
   with single ccgmsterm.s source file.

Version 5.5 (01/15/1988) (historical release by BBS)
------------------------

 - Last official shareware release. (There was actually a 5.5+ released with 
 a minor bug fix, but I've lost the source to it; if I find it, I will update
 this accordingly.)  All other versions (6.01, 8+RLE, EL2, 13.0) out there
 were unoffical hacks, as should probably be obvious if you run them.
 The original CBM assembler source is in the 'original' folder in filenames 
 5a.gs ... 5d.gs.
